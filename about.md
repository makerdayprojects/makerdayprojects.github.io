Every year around the world hackers and technologists organise and present multiple different maker events
designed to encourage people to learn, create, make and "fix" things.
Every time we do an event, from LCA Miniconf to local maker days,
we often develop new projects (new designs, new bill of materials, new training slides,â€¦.) and related stuff.

This is very hard work.

We should all make a very serious effort to store our our information for each event so it can be re-used.

This is Web site is a set of curated pages and links
that hopefully will be useful to anyone who needs to plan a maker day,
of any type and any size.
