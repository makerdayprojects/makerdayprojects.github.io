  This  site contain information about running a maker day.
  It includes details about projects, activities, table top shows, administration and general information.
  <p>
  Dive into the <a href="https://github.com/makerdayprojects/makerdayprojects.github.io/wiki">wiki</a> for more.
  <p>

  This content wil help stop people having to re-invent the wheel for every event, and to try and capture best practice.
  <p>

  Every year around the world hackers and technologists organise and present multiple different maker events
  designed to encourage people to learn, create, make and fix things.
  Every time communities manage events, from LCA Miniconf to local maker days,
  we often develop new projects (new designs, new bill of materials, new training slides,â€¦.) and related stuff.
  <p>

This is very hard work.
  <p>

  We should all make a very serious effort to save our our information for each event so it can be re-used.
  <p>

  The wiki is a set of curated pages and links
  that hopefully will be useful to anyone who needs to plan a maker day,
  of any type and any size.
