The Raspberry Pi is a complex device.
The key to successful workshop is to have a simple project that allows most people
to have a positive win before they finish.
NB This does not mean they have to finish the complete project,
but make enough progress to see something happen.

_Strong suggestion_. Have a "Things to try next" flyer so that people can discover how to carry on afterwards.

In the 1st instance roll out a software only project.
Using the same project across all the Pi workstations is a good idea.
There are a number of projects developed for school children
on the Raspberry Pi foundation website
(for instance [Wac A Block](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/minecraft-whac-a-block-game)).

## Top Tips

* Choose and set up the project so no network access is needed

* Make sure the keyboard and locale are configured correctly (configure a single SD card and then clone it.

* Have spare SD cards already set up
